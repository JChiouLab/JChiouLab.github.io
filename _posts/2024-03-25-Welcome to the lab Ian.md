Ian (許聖言) joins our lab as our first post-doc!

Ian is interested in how a dynamical system evolves. Ian used to work on how the intrinsically disordered region of a critical stress-response gene affects the stochastic pulsing in the dynamics of its expression. From its dynamics and sequence divergence in different species within Ascomycota, Ian and colleagues showed that such stochastic pulsing is likely functional and under purifying selection.

We are very fortunate to recruit Ian from Nice. He has research experience in dynamical systems theory, yeast cell biology, molecular evolution, and is super fun to be with! With us, he'll be tackling specific questions broadly within the scope of how the polarity system evolved within Ascomycota.
