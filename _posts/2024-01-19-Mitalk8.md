MiTalk was an amazing yearly symposium on microbiology held by the young scholars and for the young scholars. It has a unique popular science vibe and this year was in the beautiful Hwalien City on the east coast of Taiwan. We had a good time getting to know what other microbiologists are up to and quite a few talks are really cool!
