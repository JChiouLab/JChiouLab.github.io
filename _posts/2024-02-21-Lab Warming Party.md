The Lab is ready to roll! 

After some back and forth in design and some remodeling, I'm pretty happy to call this new space our home. The idea of the space is to facillitate organic discussion. We have so many whiteboards and drinks and snack to go with it!

For the lab warming party, Chih-Hang from across the hall made a cake that has Turing pattern on it <3
