Yu-Hsin （張郁欣）filled up the lab manager position. Thank you and welcome in!

Yu-Hsin is finishing her PhD degree on plant RNA biology in the joint program between IPMB and the Institute of Plant Science in National Taiwan University. While waiting to finish up she agreed to join my lab when we needed her the most. She will help us set up various systems in the lab. 

We will also work on how the fission yeast <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> switches between polarity modes. Unfortunately, Yu-Hsin used to work with plants and I used to work with the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> ... Well, they say a good PhD training can get a person to solve any unknown problem. Let's see how far <i>two PhD trainings</i> get us!
