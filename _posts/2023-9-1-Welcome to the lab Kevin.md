Kevin （陳楷文）joins the lab the same day I do. Welcome in!

He used to work on the photosystem fo cyanobacteria as an undergrad and a master student in National Taiwan University. He'll be starting off with the patterning mechanisms of bacterial bioflims.

Kevin is an experienced microbiologist but he's starting to learn some dynamic modeling. He has a surprisingly good appreciation of dynamic behaviors though, and he seems eager to do some coding! 

Well...at least before he starts to see those error messages...
