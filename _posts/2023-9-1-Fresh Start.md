Having spent <i>10 years</i> in the US, I'm finally back to Taiwan, home sweet home.

We're in the building right next to the one I stayed at between 2012-2013 as a research assistant. The people, the core facilities, and the science being done here all updated quite a bit. The familiar faces and humid breeze cannot be more welcoming.

Now I just need to know where the parties are. Purely for scientific purposes of course.
