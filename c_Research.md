		<h3>Patterning in an interdisciplinary field</h3>
		<p>Pattern formation is a critical and fascinating process in the development of multicellular organisms. Typically, a homogenous egg or a piece of tissue require certain proteins/mRNA to be spatially localized heterogeneously (patterned) to develop complex structures. The molecular pathways underlying different patterning systems are usually distinct depending on the system. However, they often follow similar pattern formation principles.</p>

In 1952, Alan Turing (yes, Benedict Cumberbatch in the <i>Imitation Game</i>) demonstrated that a system that consists of a slow-diffusing "activator" activating a fast-diffusing "substrate" can spontaneously generate patterns such as spots and strips. This pattern has been shown to underly the patterning of pigments on animal coat, the development of animal digits, the distribution of tricomes on plant leafs, even the vegetation in savana lanscapes.</p>
		<p>Since mathematical principles of pattern formation often transcend taxonomic boundaries and even spatial scales, why can't patterning also occur in 'unicellular' microbes? In our lab, we use interdisciplinary approaches including <b>live cell microscopy</b> and <b>mathematical modeling</b> to studies the <b>principles of pattern formation</b> that play key roles in <b>microbial developmental processes</b>. Specifically, we focus on two aspects:</p>

		<h3>Cell Polarity</h3>
		<p><span class="image right"><img src="assets/images/ResearchFigure2_wb.pdf"></span>Different cells develop in different cell polarity modes: Pollens only grow toward one direction to develop a single pollen tube; neurons grow toward multiple directions when forming dendrites. Contrasting polarity modes as such originate from the different spatial patterns of polarity proteins within a single cell. Previous studies have shown that the mathematical principles that govern the patterning of polarity proteins in the budding yeast (Ascomycota) follow that of a mass-conserved version of the Turing system, the same principle that generates the spots and stripes on your cat! Elucidating the underlying mathematical principles of yeast cell polarity has allowed us to genetically remodel the growth of budding yeast. We changed yeast cells from uni-polar budding to multi-polar growth, resembling the branching of fungal hyphae (Chiou et al., 2021, eLife).</p>
		<p><span class="image left"><<img src="assets/images/ResearchFigure2_wb.pdf"></span>To our surprise, mathematical analyses predicted two additional polarity modes that are also possible from the same polarity machinery if we apply different model parameters. On the other hand, genetic and genomic data confirmed that the entire Ascomycota shares a conserved polarity machinery. Combining the two pieces of information from theory and experiments, we ask the bigger question: What if these theoretical predictions correspond to diverse polarity modes of other Ascomycete fungi? Starting from the perspective of dynamic systems theory using partial differential systems, combined with molecular genetic experiments in different fungal species, we plan to establish a unified theoretical framework for cell polarity, using Ascomycota as a model phylum.</p>
