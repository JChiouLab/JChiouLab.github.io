	  <p><p>Ian (許聖言) joins our lab as our first post-doc!</p>

<p>Ian is interested in how a dynamical system evolves. Ian used to work on how the intrinsically disordered region of a critical stress-response gene affects the stochastic pulsing in the dynamics of its expression. From its dynamics and sequence divergence in different species within Ascomycota, Ian and colleagues showed that such stochastic pulsing is likely functional and under purifying selection.</p>

<p>We are very fortunate to recruit Ian from Nice. He has research experience in dynamical systems theory, yeast cell biology, molecular evolution, and is super fun to be with! With us, he’ll be tackling specific questions broadly within the scope of how the polarity system evolved within Ascomycota.</p>

	  <p><p>The Lab is ready to roll!</p>

<p>After some back and forth in design and some remodeling, I’m pretty happy to call this new space our home. The idea of the space is to facillitate organic discussion. We have so many whiteboards and drinks and snack to go with it!</p>

<p>For the lab warming party, Chih-Hang from across the hall made a cake that has Turing pattern on it &lt;3</p>

	  <p>2024-01-19 00:00:00 +0800</p>
	  <p><p>MiTalk was an amazing yearly symposium on microbiology held by the young scholars and for the young scholars. It has a unique popular science vibe and this year was in the beautiful Hwalien City on the east coast of Taiwan. We had a good time getting to know what other microbiologists are up to and quite a few talks are really cool!</p>

	  <p><p>Year-End fest with Ting-Ying’s lab, Laysan’s lab and Ka-Wai Ma!</p>

<p>They told me we were going to 饗饗 for an afternoon tea…and I took it literally! I had no idea 饗饗 was a high-end all-you-can-eat buffet and it was good!!</p>

<p>Our interior designer gave us this nice 3D rendering of our office space. If all goes well it will be completely remodeled by the end of the year!</p>

	  <p><p>Yu-Hsin （張郁欣）filled up the lab manager position. Thank you and welcome in!</p>

<p>Yu-Hsin is finishing her PhD degree on plant RNA biology in the joint program between IPMB and the Institute of Plant Science in National Taiwan University. While waiting to finish up she agreed to join my lab when we needed her the most. She will help us set up various systems in the lab.</p>

<p>We will also work on how the fission yeast <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> switches between polarity modes. Unfortunately, Yu-Hsin used to work with plants and I used to work with the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> … Well, they say a good PhD training can get a person to solve any unknown problem. Let’s see how far <i>two PhD trainings</i> get us!</p>

	  <p>2023-09-01 00:00:00 +0800</p>
	  <p><p>Kevin （陳楷文）joins the lab the same day I do. Welcome in!</p>

<p>He used to work on the photosystem fo cyanobacteria as an undergrad and a master student in National Taiwan University. He’ll be starting off with the patterning mechanisms of bacterial bioflims.</p>

<p>Kevin is an experienced microbiologist but he’s starting to learn some dynamic modeling. He has a surprisingly good appreciation of dynamic behaviors though, and he seems eager to do some coding!</p>

<p>Well…at least before he starts to see those error messages…</p>

	  <p><p>Having spent <i>10 years</i> in the US, I’m finally back to Taiwan, home sweet home.</p>

<p>We’re in the building right next to the one I stayed at between 2012-2013 as a research assistant. The people, the core facilities, and the science being done here all updated quite a bit. The familiar faces and humid breeze cannot be more welcoming.</p>

<p>Now I just need to know where the parties are. Purely for scientific purposes of course.</p>
