# How to Use

Jekyll uses markdown language (.md files) to control the contents of the webpage. 

To edit the pages, simple edit the .md files in the root directory that correspond to the respective pages.

To add images, upload the images to assets>images, and then call them in the .md files.

To control how a page looks on the homepage and landing page, edit the "froont matter" (the code sandwitched between the upper and the lower "---"). 

To add a post in the News' section, add new .md files in the "\_posts" directory.  Notice that the file name has to be "YYYY_M_DD-title.md".

After you finished editing the pages, remember to deploy the website using 'Actions'
