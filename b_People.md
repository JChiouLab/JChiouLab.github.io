				<p><i><b>Principal Investigator.</b><br>A self-proclaimed biologist when I need an excuse for being bad at physics. A self-proclaimed physicist when I honestly can’t remember that many genes.</i><br>
				I went to Duke University to pursue my PhD and origianlly my interest in evolution and development (evo-devo). Less than a year later, I ditched my original interest and studies how a budding yeast bud. That question accidentally became a physics problem of how certain proteins autonomously pattern in the yeast cell. Before I realized, I was attending more physics meetings than biology ones. After graduation, I went to do a postdoc in UCSD. Having the advantage of (moderately) knowing both biology and physics, I published barely enough to start my own lab in the Institute of Plant and Molecular Biology (IPMB) in Academia Sinica, Taiwan. I now plan to answer fundamentally evo-devos question using biophysics approaches.</p>

				<p><i><b>Lab manager/Research Assistant.</b><br> A PhD candidate has a 50 percent chance of becoming a doctor.</i><br>I liked biology and graduated from the department of life sciences. I liked plants, so I studied plant science. I liked doing experiments, so I worked as a research assistant and even became a PhD student. The coin has been tossed, but no one's exactly sure which side it will land on. While I wait, I came to this lab. Currently, I'm exploring my career working as a lab manager to determine whether I prefer a role as a scientist or a scientific assistant.</p>

					<h3>陳楷文 Kevin Chen</h3>

				<p><i><b>Research Assistant</b></i><br>Throughout my academic journey, I immersed myself in microbiology during my master’s program. My focus was on a remarkable subject—ancient cyanobacteria with the extraordinary ability to perform photosynthesis. This rigorous training period honed my skills in manipulating genes within non-model bacterial organisms and delved into the intricacies of bacterial photophysiology. After graduation, I wanted to expand my horizons beyond traditional microbiology. I delved into the realm of dry lab work, encompassing mathematics, coding, and the multifaceted domain of biophysics. This endeavor represents an exciting fusion of my microbiology background with the quantitative and computational aspects of biophysics.</p>
