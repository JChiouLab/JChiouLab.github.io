			<h2>Patterning is an interdisciplinary field</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Pattern formation is a fascinating process critical in the development of multicellular organisms. During multicellular development, certain proteins need to spatially distribute in certain patterns so that cells localized at specific positions can differentiate correctly. Interestingly, the underlying molecular pathways for pattern formation are completely different between distinct phylogenetic clades, but they often follow similar mathematical principles.</p>
		<P>Since mathematical principles often transcend taxonomic boundaries, patterning may also occur in 'unicellular' microbes. Using interdisciplinary approaches including live cell microscopy and mathematical modeling, we studies the principles of pattern formation that play key roles in microbial developmental processes. Specifically, we focus on two aspects:</p>

					<h3>Cell Polarity</h3>
				</header>
				<p>How does the same polarity machinery result in diverse growth modes? The answer lies within the intra-cellular pattern formation process of polarity proteins. We explore how the recently developed Turing theoretical framework could explain cell polarity modes in not only the budding yeast but also the diversity of growth modes among Ascomycete fungi.</p>

					<h3>Biofilm development</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Forty years after the clock-and-wavefront model was proposed, the vertebrate embryogenesis field has learned that self-organization mechanisms of the cell-autonomous oscillators in individual cells is critical to generate a collective pattern. Biofilms are multicellular communities of bacteria. How is collective patterning achieved in developing bacterial bioflims?</p>

			<h2>We are recruiting!</h2>
		</header>
		<p>We believe that disciplines are artificial constructs that are no longer meaningful. If something is useful on the trajectory of evolution, life will pick it up. It doesn't matter whether that thing is a pathway taught in <i>Cell Biology</i> or a mathematical concept taught in <i>Linear Algebra</i>. We, who try to understand the path of life, must also break the boundaries of disciplines and learn the languages of our friends who are trained differently and therefore think differently. </p>
		<p>We are looking for friends. Whether you were trained as a <b>Cell Biologist</b>, a <b>Developmental Biologist</b>, a <b>Microbiologist</b>, a <b>Physicist</b>, or a <b>Mathmatical modeler</b>, join us. </p><p>As long as you are interested in microbial patterning, you'll learn fast.</p>
