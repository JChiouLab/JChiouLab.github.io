<p>We believe that disciplines are artificial constructs that are no longer meaningful. If something is useful on the trajectory of evolution, life will pick it up. It doesn't matter whether that thing is a pathway taught in <i>Cell Biology</i> or a mathematical concept taught in <i>Linear Algebra</i>. We, who try to understand the path of life, must also break the boundaries of disciplines and learn the languages of our friends who are trained differently and therefore think differently. </p>
<p>We are looking for friends. Whether you were trained as a <b>Cell Biologist</b>, a <b>Developmental Biologist</b>, a <b>Microbiologist</b>, a <b>Physicist</b>, or a <b>Mathmatical modeler</b>, join us. </p>
<p>As long as you are interested in microbial patterning, you'll learn fast.</p>
